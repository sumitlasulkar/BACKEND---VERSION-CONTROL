Git & Git Hub


devices too sometimes, to merge diffrent programs codes are diffrent, sendiing it on whatsapp or email is not easy ,  so we need to collobrate images

// solution : so we can create centeral codebase, we can add all files on these central base whenever we want, GitHub is a central Database which is done on global points while Git is a central library on our local device 
Simply Git and GitHub is creating version contolling and managing and collobrating in project

// install Git through website
// extensions : 1.Git Blame 2.Git autoconfiug  3.GitHub Theme
// check install or not by command " git -version"

// to set Git Globally use following command in command prompt

1. to set your name and email globally 
-> git config --global user.name "name"
-> git config --global user.email "emai;@gmail.com"

2. which code editor we are using 
when any problem in git then it will show wait command
autocrif use to make lines on windows and mac
-> git config --global core.editor "code--wait"
-> git config --global core.autocrif

3. use to check and change values set
-> git config -e

// Managing project with Git
// by checking following things in front of file name
1. U - untracked - git dont know about file, git is not managing it also represent as ??
2. A - added or stagged - git is aware about file, git know these file exist
3. C - commited - git tracking the file, and managing file

making git available in your project
in vs code cclick on source panel (3rd one)
click on " intialize repository " : now vs code is managing theese project

first time all files are untracked
so make stage changes:
go on file,  press '+' icon to make it added or stagged

Creating a check point or saved point to file:
ex. 2.txt 
select file, right what you want to save in text box above commited
and press commit button 
now 2.txt is a savepoint
now again write anything 
you see 
M - modified tab
to accept changes again press'+' icon
again it will go on stagged changes

to check saved points use command
it will tell checkpoints name and there info
-> git log --oneline
it will give info of particular savepoint
-> git status -s
one more command
-> git log --oneline --graph

git status only shows status of non commited files or get changed after commited
git status tells about file changes and about its states before and after file commited
git log tells all file history and savepoint and commit history 
it tells which file is commited before

** .gitignore file
if we right name of any file in this file then git will ignore these file and never manage it
git never recognize these file

going back to previous saved point
use command (hard, soft, mixed)  1 represents one step back, 2 represents two step reverse
-> git reset --hard HEAD~1
-> git reset --hard HEAD~2


BRANCHING in Git:
ex. there is main file in project 
    now we had to make change in main file so we create another file heaer and provide duplicate main file to header file make necessary changes in it then entire header file and main file is merge into main file
    header =  header + main file
    we make necessary changes 
    now again we merge entire header +  main file = main file
    adding footer too main file
    footer =   footer + main file
    now again we merge entire footer +  main file = main file
this is callled as BRANCHING

CONFLICT GIT:
ex. now imagine we have main file of 33 lines
    we want to add one more file it is also 33 lines
    now we edit main file again into 34 lines
    also edit additional file into 34 lines
    at that git will get confuse to  choose which file
these confusion is called as CONFLICT
so in conflict you can take main file, additional file , also both file

creating branch:
command
-> git branch branchName/Additional file name
ex. git branch feature/navbar
-> git branch

use command to select branch
-> git switch feature/navbar
now you are on navbar branch

to merge additional file then use following command
to merge we always should be on main file
-> git switch main
-> git merge feature/navbar

now right diffrent code in main and navbar file of same line
run command for merging
you will now get CONFLICT
now you get option
1. accept current change
2. accept incoming changes 
3. accept both

select one option click on it
now again add file using + and commit changes

there are many mrging techniques:
ff, three way, squash, recursive stratergy, rebase

three way merge:
          a1 ---------a2
         /                   central commit
m1 --- m2 ----------- m3        
now by combining a2, m2,m3 central is created
a presents brach. m presents main file

Fast forward merge:
     a1------a2
   /
m1
consider head at m1, now after conflict head goes to a2 in ff merge

*Deleting branch command
-> git branch -d feature/navbar


STASHING:
    you created one branch and you write some code in it but you nevercommit that code 
    still you are trying to go in another branch then git will tell no save points, 
    so changes can be delete. So you can delete changes or draft them.
    If you draft them, changes will never get deleted nor added  it remain somewhere middle
    you can use these changes again after you want

    after getting error due to unsaved changes
    command:
    -> git stash
    if you want changes again
    -> git switch apply

command:
-> git switch -C feature/footer
it means you are switching to branch as well as youare creating branch




GIT HUB

COMMON STEPS:
1. main person create folder and initial file
2. upload on git Hub
3. Add collobraters(other team members) 
4. collobraters should create clone of uploaded file
5. collobraters should create own branch
6. collobraters should write code in branch
7. after that commit changes & push them and inform to other teammates
8. merger(main person) checks branch and merge it and repush it

these steps we are going to do on git hub by creating resporities and other things
